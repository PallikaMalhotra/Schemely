ðŸš€ Overview
This is a web application designed to help users discover relevant government schemes based on filters like age, gender, area, education, and state. It stays in sync with changes made through the v0.dev interface.

ðŸ”— **Live Backend API**: [https://govt-scheme-api-c8a1.onrender.com/](https://govt-scheme-api-c8a1.onrender.com/)  
Provides real-time government scheme recommendations using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, deployed via Render.
